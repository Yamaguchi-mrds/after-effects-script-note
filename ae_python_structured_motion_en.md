# 1. Introduction
## üîç Terminology and Basic Concepts

Below are simplified definitions of key technical terms frequently used in this document. More detailed technical definitions will be supplemented in each chapter where appropriate.

- **Structure-driven**: A method of generating visuals based on data structures defined in code, rather than GUI operations.
- **Bezier Path**: Curve data with control points used to construct smooth shapes; a fundamental format in After Effects Shape Layers.
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight text format used to describe data structures. Used as an intermediary file format between Python and AE.
- **JSX (ExtendScript)**: A JavaScript-based scripting language used for automation in After Effects.
- **Morphing**: An animation technique that transforms one shape into another. In this project, it's controlled via Bezier structures.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: A visual interface format that users operate with mouse etc. AE adopts this format.

---

This document proposes a motion graphics production environment that replaces GUI-driven production with a "structure-driven" approach by linking two fundamentally different tools: Adobe After Effects (hereinafter AE) and Python.

While AE provides an excellent editing environment for sophisticated visual expressions, it has fundamental limitations when it comes to behavior design that incorporates control theory or mathematical approaches. Although GUI-based intuitive operations are powerful, they show clear limitations in applications that require controlling complex structures repeatedly or synchronizing with external data.

Mechanisms within AE, such as Expressions and ExtendScript, have been explored, but none of them are suitable for modern structural design or abstract control. They also pose significant constraints for flexible expansion and reuse.

From these challenges, the idea emerged to clearly divide roles: ‚Äústructure definition and control handled by Python, and rendering handled by AE.‚Äù

Python excels in numerical processing, geometric operations, external application integration, and data visualization. In this project, all shape structures are defined and constructed in Python as Bezier paths. AE receives this structural information via JSON and handles only the rendering.

This approach makes it possible to construct theoretically driven shape generation, deformation, and structure-based morphing animations‚Äîtasks difficult to realize through GUI operations. Furthermore, abstraction and functionalization of structures and reuse of configurations become possible. This establishes a new collaborative model: ‚ÄúAE as a rendering device‚Äù and ‚ÄúPython as a structure design tool.‚Äù

---

### The following table compares the traditional AE environment with the proposed structure-driven approach:

| Perspective         | Traditional (AE-centric)            | Proposed (AE + Python Integration)      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Production Method   | GUI-centric operation               | Structure generation and control by code |
| Language Environment| ExtendScript (equivalent to Java 1.5)| Python 3 (modern syntax and rich libraries) |
| Structural Abstraction | Difficult (manual path editing)    | Defined and reusable via functions/data structures |
| External Integration| Limited (self-contained within AE)  | Real-time integration with other apps/external signals |
| Motion Control      | Timeline editing or simple expressions | Driven by geometric operations and mathematical models |

The next chapter will describe the background leading to this concept and the issues encountered in the conventional environment.


# 2. Background and Awareness of Issues

Traditionally, structural control in video production has relied on methods that are completed entirely within AE (Adobe After Effects). AE excels at visual operations via GUI and has a strong reputation in motion graphics production.  
However, when structural designs based on control theory or complex algorithm-driven behaviors are needed, the following clear limitations arise:

- **Human-dependence of operations**: In a GUI-based system, replicating the same structure requires repeated manual actions, which lacks reusability and automation.
- **Limited expressiveness**: AE Expressions allow for simple mathematical controls but are unsuitable for building complex logic.
- **Outdated development environment**: AE scripts based on ExtendScript (equivalent to JavaScript 1.5) do not support modern programming paradigms or debugging features.

For example, automatic shape placement, dynamic Bezier deformation, or generation control based on multiple conditions are difficult to achieve with AE alone. Expression's hierarchical structure is limited, making dynamic structural switching and advanced recursive logic difficult to implement.

---

## üß© Transition: From JavaScript to Python

Initially, development attempted to utilize AE's standard features, implementing with Expressions and ExtendScript. Since Bezier paths and transformations could be described within AE, some results were achieved in the prototype phase.

However, fundamental barriers arose:

- The language is outdated, lacking strong **object orientation** and **function reusability**
- **Insufficient traceability and log output** during errors
- Weak **code completion and syntax support** in the JSX editor

As a result, the policy shifted toward migrating the structural design process to an external environment. To handle control design and structural generation more flexibly, Python was adopted.

---

## üöÄ Significance of Introducing Python

Python was chosen for the following reasons:

- **Strong computational capabilities**: Efficient description of vector/matrix operations, signal analysis, interpolation, etc.
- **General-purpose data handling**: Native support for formats like JSON, CSV, images, and audio
- **Rich library ecosystem**: NumPy, OpenCV, SciPy, Pillow, TensorFlow, etc.
- **Integration with other apps**: Designed with Python-based control in tools like Blender and TouchDesigner

Moreover, defining shapes as structured Bezier data (vertices / inTangents / outTangents) enables **functional control of the entire structure**, including dynamic path generation and morphing.

---

## üîÅ From GUI to Structure: A Paradigm Shift

The core concept here is a shift from ‚Äúmanual GUI operation‚Äù to ‚Äúdesign via structural definition.‚Äù

GUI-style workflow:

1. Draw a shape using the Pen tool  
2. Add motion in the timeline  
3. Control animation with keyframes

In contrast, the structural approach:

1. Generate point groups using Python functions  
2. Convert them into Bezier structures and build morph paths  
3. Serialize as JSON and send to AE for rendering

This conceptual shift enables video production based on **reusable structural design**, allowing for complex transformations, integrations, and reconstructions.

---

## Beyond Tools: A New Production Philosophy

By defining shapes as Bezier structures (vertices / inTangents / outTangents), functional control of the entire structure‚Äîincluding dynamic path generation and morphing‚Äîbecomes possible.

Furthermore, most existing integrations between Python and After Effects focus on productivity tools such as "asset management" or "batch layer generation." In contrast, this project offers a fundamentally different approach‚Äî**designing the video itself as a structure**. By clearly separating structural definition, control, and rendering into reusable data structures, it presents a shift not just in production tools, but in production philosophy itself.

---

The next chapter introduces the overall architecture of the four-phase control system designed as a solution to these issues.


# 3. System Overview

The proposed ‚ÄúStructure-based Video Generation Environment with AE + Python‚Äù clearly separates the roles of structure definition, logic processing, and rendering control, assigning each role to the most appropriate technology stack.

This system is composed of four clearly defined phases:

[1] Generation (GEN)  
„ÄÄ‚Üì Python: Generate shape point groups (functional structure)

[2] Structuring (BUILD)  
„ÄÄ‚Üì Python: Convert Bezier ‚Üí AE layer data structure

[3] Data Export (EXPORT)  
„ÄÄ‚Üì Python: Save as JSON (intermediate file)

[4] Rendering Execution (DRAW)  
„ÄÄ‚Üì After Effects: Read JSON with JSX ‚Üí Draw layers

---

## üìê Overview of Each Phase

### ‚ë† GEN: Structure Generation

- Arbitrary shapes (circles, stars, polygons, image-based forms, etc.) are generated functionally in Python.
- The generated shapes are described as Bezier structures (`vertices`, `inTangents`, `outTangents`).
- To support morphing, consistency in vertex count and order is ensured.

### ‚ë° BUILD: Structuring for AE

- Bezier structures are converted into AE-readable layer-formatted dictionaries.
- The data includes layer names, fill settings, positions, styles, etc.
- Unified processing via functions like `build_shape_layer()`.

### ‚ë¢ EXPORT: Output as Intermediate Format

- The finalized structural data is saved as a JSON file.
- This JSON functions as the "blueprint" for drawing instructions to AE.
- Exported with a clear file structure (e.g., `/s04_export_json/ae_data.json`).

### ‚ë£ DRAW: Visual Rendering in AE

- A JSX script (`load_json_ae.jsx`) reads the JSON and generates layers in AE.
- Bezier structures are restored as `ShapeLayer`s and visualized.
- Drawing is handled using AE‚Äôs built-in scripting mechanisms (auto-execution).

This structural separation enables flexible design of dynamic shape generation and external data integration‚Äîpreviously difficult within AE‚Äôs timeline editing. With AE acting as a visualization tool and Python as a structure design engine, reusability and extensibility are greatly enhanced.

This approach minimizes dependency on AE while significantly expanding the freedom of structural design and creative expression. For example, tasks like random placement, dynamic point control, or complex morphing‚Äîchallenging to perform manually in AE‚Äîcan now be flexibly defined in Python code.

---

### üìã Supplement: Phase Responsibility Summary

| Phase  | Responsible     | Main Task                                      |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| GEN    | Python          | Shape design and generation (Bezier structure) |
| BUILD  | Python          | Structuring for AE (with style and position)   |
| EXPORT | Python          | Intermediate output as JSON (shared format for AE) |
| DRAW   | After Effects   | JSON reading and layer rendering (final visual stage) |

---

## üß† A Shift from "Editing" to "Structural Drawing"

This approach flips the typical paradigm: rather than "editing inside AE to produce visuals," it focuses on "designing the structure in Python and letting AE render it."

For example, the following workflows become possible:

> A mathematically defined dodecagon ‚Üí Converted to a styled, positioned structure ‚Üí Exported as JSON ‚Üí Rendered in AE  
> Audio data converted into a spectrum ‚Üí Point group generated ‚Üí Animated structure built ‚Üí Displayed dynamically in AE  

By clearly separating structure and expression, freedom of control, integration flexibility, and reusability have all been dramatically improved.

---

The next chapter delves into the design policy and modular structure of each phase comprising the proposed system.


# 4. Design Principles

The design of this system is based on three pillars: ‚Äústructure for expression,‚Äù ‚Äúcontrollable data design,‚Äù and ‚Äúexpandable system modularity.‚Äù

Whereas traditional video production is a process that operates toward a final output (the video), this concept takes a **reversed approach**: design the structure (data) and hand it off to a rendering engine.

---

## üß± Basic Unit of Structure Definition: Bezier Paths

All shape data is centrally managed using a **Bezier curve structure** compatible with Adobe After Effects:

- `vertices`: List of vertex coordinates
- `inTangents`: Control points leading into each vertex
- `outTangents`: Control points leading out of each vertex
- `closed`: Optional flag indicating whether the path is closed

Unifying the data structure in this way provides the following benefits:

- Diverse shapes (circles, polygons, stars, free-form curves) managed under one system
- Morphing becomes possible if vertex count and order are fixed
- Easy conversion to JSON ‚Üí Simplified AE integration

---

## üß© Modular Composition and Separation of Responsibilities

On the Python side, code is **modularized by function** with clearly defined responsibilities:

| Module              | Role                                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `shape_gen.py`      | Generates point groups in Bezier format (circle, polygon, star, etc.) |
| `build_layer.py`    | Converts Bezier data into AE layer dictionary structure |
| `write_ae_json.py`  | Outputs AE data as JSON                                |
| `load_json_ae.jsx`  | Loads JSON in AE and renders as layers                 |
| `run_aefx_json.py`  | Launches AfterFX via CLI and runs rendering script     |

This separation significantly improves **debuggability, reusability, and extensibility**, providing a flexible foundation that can scale to advanced use cases.

---

## üìÑ Benefits of JSON as an Intermediate Format

Integration with AE is achieved by outputting the structured data as a JSON file.  
Adopting this intermediate format yields several design advantages:

- **AE can be treated as a black box**: Complete separation between design and rendering
- **Human-readable structure**: Ideal for debugging, formatting, and logging
- **Cross-app compatibility**: JSON can be handled by other tools like TouchDesigner or Unity

Here is an example of actual AE JSON output:

```json
{
  "name": "Circle_A",
  "type": "bezier",
  "path": {
    "vertices": [[0, -100], [100, 0], [0, 100], [-100, 0]],
    "inTangents": [[30, 0], [0, -30], [-30, 0], [0, 30]],
    "outTangents": [[-30, 0], [0, 30], [30, 0], [0, -30]]
  },
  "style": {
    "fill": true,
    "color": [1, 0.2, 0.2],
    "opacity": 100
  },
  "transform": {
    "position": [960, 540]
  }
}
```

As shown, structure and visual data are clearly separated, making this approach adaptable to non-AE environments as well.

---

## üß† Data-Driven Reusability

By shifting from ‚ÄúGUI-based creation‚Äù to ‚Äústructured design,‚Äù each dataset becomes reusable and reconstructable via logic.

For example:
- Automatically generate multiple sizes by scaling the same point group
- Parameterize color, opacity, and position for random placement
- Reconstruct and re-output designs via GUI or external signals

This design is adaptable for various applications, including auto-generation, structural motion graphics, academic simulations, educational content, and visual effect templates.

---

## 5.4 Technical Core and Design Philosophy

The reason for such diverse integration and application possibilities lies in the adoption of the following design principles:

- **Structure described in JSON**: A standardized, human-readable data format compatible with non-AE tools
- **Control and computation written in Python**: Covers structure generation, signal processing, external communication, and GUI
- **AE used solely as a rendering device** while design/control is independently managed externally

This ensures flexibility to evolve into a structure-driven, control-oriented video production environment with minimal reliance on After Effects.
